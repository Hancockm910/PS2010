SET A - SACRED

The inevitable,
flowing,
mindlessly,
washing away â€“ 
the turn,
the tide,
in this rising space 
Falling,
pushing,
rising, 
slowly into
hypnosis
A pause, 
a thought
symbiosis
The impulsive
promise of
tomorrow 
inevitably running
to somewhere
sacred and safe 
The cosmic 
knowing of
reality 
bleeds 
into tomorrow 
My knees bent  
a prayer
shifting
truth
Like water
surges
Forgiveness
looks like
tomorrow
The shoreline
gently 
pulls away
blues and whites
Finding grace
