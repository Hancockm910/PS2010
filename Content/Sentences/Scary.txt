SET C - SCARY

The passing
of time 
ebbing
together
crashes 
a whisper 
BETRAYAL 
long gone
The chest  
expands  
breaking 
teardrops on teardrops on teardrops  
acid rain   
smoke  
fills 
the air
Coruscate  
into my haven  
Plumbless, 
breathless
Deep into 
the dusk 
youâ€™ll find me
Grace  
bounded  
in time 
A journey  
into the end 
where Death arrives
The loneliness 
demandingly 
forebodingly
incites 
fear
desire 
a touch 
unspoken, unwelcome  
undesirable  
SHOUTING 
SHOUTING  
SHOUTING
