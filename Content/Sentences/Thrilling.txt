SET B - THRILLING

The glittering 
escape 
worlds bound
in defiance 
to new
adventures 
yet discovered 
You are here
The welcome feast
of love 
love 
boldly 
intoxicatingly
wraps itself 
on the surface 
Dancing 
Magic 
rides   
up  
an open  
hand 
bringing 
warmth
Dilated eyes 
on mine   
inquisitively   
asking 
Electricity   
weaves  
its reach 
gloriously golden  
the aorta  
wrapping itself 
in a windstorm 
Trust 
trust  
trust 
The Mountain  
stays 
in pursuit  
of beautiful  
wonderful  
you
